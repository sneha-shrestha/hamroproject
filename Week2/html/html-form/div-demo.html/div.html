            Chetan Bhagat has taken a different path in this book. He himself
            got tired of love stories. This book is a thriller love story. The
            main characters of the book are Keshav, Saurab, and Zara. Keshav is
            an IITian who works as a teacher in JEE tuition center called
            ‘Chandan Classes’. He hates his job and reaches out through
            LinkedIn, but fails to find a proper job. He is a part of an
            orthodox family. His mother is a homemaker and his father is a part
            of the RSS, which is a political party in India. As always, he has a
            love story with a colleague called Zara, who is currently pursuing
            her Ph.D. in IIT. Zara is from a Kashmiri Muslim family and their
            love story ends due to their families, who fight over religious
            issues. Let’s not get into that. If you are an Indian and reading
            this, you would know the issues an inter-religion couple would face
            in the country. Keshav couldn’t come out of the affair and keeps
            remembering Zara, who then loves Raghav(Keshav’s classmate). Raghav
            happens to be an intelligent person with a geeky look. Keshav often
            calls Zara begging her to come back to him, but she never agrees.
            Saurabh also works in ‘Chandan’s Classes’. He is from NIT and is a
            friend of Keshav. He helps Keshav forget his past love and focus on
            his future.

            As the title of the book suggests, Zara is the occupant of the Room
            No:‘105’. It is Zara’s birthday and unfortunately Raghav is beaten
            up by some goons and is at Apollo hospital. Keshav controls his urge
            to call Zara and wish her for her birthday at midnight. He and
            Saurabh drink wine and fall asleep. Around 3 a.m. in the morning, he
            gets a text from Zara, who asks him why he didn’t wish this year. He
            is shocked to get a text from her. Zara goes on and tells him to
            meet him in her room immediately. Keshav rushes to the girls’ hostel
            with Saurabh. He shows a fake ID card and enters the hostel. He
            climbs up the mango tree and slides into the window of Zara’s room,
            which is kept open waiting for his arrival. The room is dark and it
            is utterly silent. Zara is asleep on the bed. He touches her
            forehead and feels a cold chill. He then switches on the light and
            sees her dead. He is shocked, scared and sad altogether to see his
            love, like a corpse on her birthday. He informs Saurabh who suggests
            they run away from the scene. But Keshav becomes determined to find
            the killer. The rest of the story is his journey where he stands by
            Zara after her death to find justice.

            Keshav goes through a journey of suspects. He informs the police,
            Raghav and Zara’s parents. The police arrests the watchman of the
            hostel, who is missed from the CCTV camera during the time Zara was
            killed. But, we all know that the story doesn’t end so easily.
            Keshav digs deeper, with the help of the police- Inspector Rana. He
            first suspects Prof.Saxena(the Ph.D. guide), who tries to harass
            Zara. It is then proved that Saxena has a limp and could have never
            climbed the mango tree on the night of Zara’s death. He then tries
            to find Sikander, Zara’s stepbrother who happens to be part of a
            terrorist group in Kashmir. Keshav seeks help from Zara’s father and
            checks her room for clues. He finds a locker with gunpowder,
            pregnancy kits and selfies of Sikander with a gun along with Zara
            who happens to be smiling in the picture. Keshav goes through the
            clues one by one. He first tries to meet Sikander and asks him about
            his group called TEJ. Sikander gets afraid and threatnes them with a
            gun and runs away. They try to reach him out through his mother in
            Kashmir. Sikander meets them again and tries to explain that he is
            not the murderer. But with the proper clues, Keshav almost gets
            convinced that Sikander killed his sister in the fear that TEJ might
            be known to the Army. The next day Sikander kills himself, telling
            that his existence would harm TEJ and convince everyone that he
            killed his dear sister. Keshav is back to square one and realizes he
            made a mistake of doubting Sikander.<br />He then thinks about the
            pregnancy kits and sees a picture of an army official in Kashmir
            with Zara in her Instagram. After proper investigation, he finds
            that the army official has gifted Zara expensive jewelry and they
            raid his house in Delhi. They find the same pregnancy kits and
            checks his internet history, which has search histories related to
            abortion and divorce. They also find gold blocks in his house and
            gets convinced with the theory that he made Zara pregnant and killed
            her in guilt. They arrange a dinner party to announce the victim and
            arrest him unknowingly by inviting everyone Zara knew, after the
            100th day of her death.
