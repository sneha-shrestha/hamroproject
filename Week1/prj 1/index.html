        >It Ends with us is a romance novel by Collen Hoover published by Atria
        books on august 2 2016. It's a story about women's struggle to break the
        cycle of abuse and rise above to create a safe life not only for herself
        but for her child. It's a love story about choosing oneself over someone
        they love deeply; it's about choosing to end a cycle of violence that
        hurts more people than it helps. This book taught me how women in
        situations of domestic violence may feel torn between someone they took
        a vow for and their own personal well-being and safety.<br /><img

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p class="display">
      The novel opens with Lily a young college graduate living in Boston on a
      rooftop, clearing her thoughts after her fathers funeral. There, she
      encounters Ryle Kincaid, a resident surgeon. The couple has chemistry, but
      it becomes clear that both have different aims when it comes to
      relationships. Ryle only wants a casual fling, while Lily is looking for a
      relationship. The two part ways but meet again six months later, when Lily
      hires Ryles sister, Allysa, to work at a flower shop she has recently
      opened. Lily and Ryles attraction to each other only increases the more
      they happen upon each other, until Ryle decides to explore a relationship
      with Lily, despite his earlier reluctance. Throughout this time, Lily
      finds herself revisiting her past and longing for closure with the death
      of her father, who was abusive towards her mother. To find it, she rereads
      old journals that she wrote when she was 15. Those journals narrate her
      encounter with Atlas Corrigan, a homeless, 18-year-old boy. As a teen,
      Lily was moved to help him when he was without a home and family, and they
      became close when he supported Lily through her witnessing her father
      abusing her mother. In the present day, Lily wonders if she isn’t also
      seeking closure with Atlas as well.

      This seems to be the case as Lily meets Ryle’s parents, and she and Ryle
      decide to get married. One night, Ryle finds Atlas’s number in Lily’s
      phone. Jealous and upset, Ryle leaves.<br />
      When Lily goes after him to try to explain, Ryle pushes her down the
      stairs. In the aftermath, Ryle at first refuses responsibility for his
      actions, and simply asks Lily to tell him that she isn’t being unfaithful.
      Lily explains how Atlas came to her shop, and throws Ryle out of her
      apartment. Ryle again pleads for forgiveness, and even approaches his
      sister, who intercedes for Ryle. Ryle tells Lily the story of how his
      brother died when 6-year-old Ryle accidentally shot him. Since then, Ryle
      confesses, he has suffered from rages. Lily is torn between her feelings
      for Ryle and the resemblances between her situation, and the abusive
      situation between her father and mother. Lily tells him that she is
      willing to help Ryle, but that she needs to know when he needs help.

        again confronts Lily over her relationship with Atlas, threatening her,
        almost raping her, and hurting her when she tries to defend herself.
        Lily calls Atlas and leaves to the hospital, where she discovers that
        she is pregnant.</em

      Distraught, Lily goes to stay with Atlas for several days. Ryle finds her
      at her shop after, but tells her that he is leaving for England for three
      months. Not ready to go back to her apartment, Lily returns to Atlas’s
      place. As time passes, Lily feels torn about telling both Allysa and her
      mother about her pregnancy. She feels alone and in need of their support,
      but she is frightened that they will convince her to take Ryle back.
      Allysa, however, suspects that something has happened between Lily and
      Ryle and confronts Lily. Relieved, Lily discusses the abuse she’s
      suffered, as well as her pregnancy.

      Ryle has returned and learned about Lily’s pregnancy. He wants her
      forgiveness, but Lily keeps him at a distance. Eventually, she lets him
      participate as a father, helping her during the final months of the
      pregnancy. Despite accepting his help, Lily refuses to make a decision
      about their relationship before the birth. After Lily gives birth to a
      girl, she realizes that she doesn’t want her baby to grow up witnessing
      abuse. She decides that she will divorce Ryle to break the pattern of
      domestic violence. Eleven months later, she runs into Atlas and indicates
      that she is ready to have a relationship with him.
